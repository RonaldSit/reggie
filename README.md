**Note**: This project is a food delivery backend system built with Spring Boot and MySQL. It currently supports user registration/login, menu management, order management, and employee information management.

Delivery features (such as driver assignment and real-time tracking) are planned but not implemented yet, as they require long-term server hosting.

This project is intended for learning and portfolio demonstration purposes.
